The game features:
* 3 levels
* 8 towers with upgrades
* 8 types of enemies
* High score database

# How to play offline
The high score database only works if you have a database server running. This can be done locally with xampp.

* Install XAMPP (or one of the many alternatives)
* Clone the entire repository into \(xampp directory)\htdocs
* Start Apache and MySQL server
* Open up a web browser
* Go to localhost/InframiesTD/index
* Take in the smell of spaghetti code
